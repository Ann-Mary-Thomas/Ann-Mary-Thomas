## 🔍 About Me  
**Data Analyst & AI Researcher | Energy Analytics | Sustainability & Decarbonisation | Deep Learning**

I'm a data analyst and AI researcher specializing in energy system analytics, sustainability, and decarbonisation strategies. With an MSc in Data Analytics and a background in Mechanical Engineering, I bridge advanced analytics with practical impact—turning complex data into actionable insights that drive sustainable transformation.

Current Focus:
At 3T Additive Manufacturing, I'm developing a comprehensive roadmap for energy consumption reduction, cost optimization, and CO₂ minimization across manufacturing operations. I analyze operational data to design evidence-based policies that reduce environmental impact while maintaining efficiency.

At London Metropolitan University's Genesis Lab, I lead cutting-edge research on U.S. energy systems using hybrid AI architectures (LSTM+Attention, RNN, RBM+MLP) with real-time EIA-930 grid data. My work combines predictive modeling, scenario-based analysis, and renewable penetration simulations (10-50% solar integration) to forecast electricity demand and CO₂ emissions. These findings are being prepared for academic publication and contribute to sustainable energy planning.

Industry Experience:
As a Junior Data Analyst at Navalt Solar and Electric Boats, I analyzed operational data from 600+ ships, built marine CO₂ emission models, and reduced data processing time by 75% through Python automation—supporting data-driven decisions in green marine technology.

What Drives Me:
I thrive on translating complex datasets into clear, impactful narratives through interactive dashboards, predictive models, and scenario analysis. My curiosity drives me to explore emerging techniques in time-series forecasting, deep learning, and renewable energy analytics—always making insights accessible and actionable for stakeholders.

💡 Core Skills:
Energy & Emissions Forecasting • Deep Learning (LSTM/RNN/Attention Mechanisms) • Renewable Integration Analysis • Python (TensorFlow, scikit-learn, Pandas) • Power BI • SQL • Data Visualization • Scenario Modeling • CRISP-DM • Stakeholder Engagement
